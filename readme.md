# Apricot

A canvas note-taking app.

A lot of the code has been generated by Claude.

### Installation

`npx apricot-notes` should install and run a webserver! Try it out at [localhost:3003](https://localhost:3003).

### How to

- Click anywhere to create your first note
- `enter` to create a new note below the current note
- `cmd+enter` to create a new note to the right of the current note
- `tab` to move the note to the right
- `shift+tab` to move the note to the left
- `ctrl+` arrow keys to move a single note when editing
- `cmd+/` to search different canvases
- `backspace` to delete notes when selecting
- `cmd+z` to undo an action
- `cmd+shift+z` or `cmd+y` to redo an action
- `cmd+left click` to insert a note in the middle of a list

### Other things

- Any change is saved to the server immediately
- A lot of markdown syntax is supported:
  - headings
  - bullets
  - links `[](...)` work if that is the only content of the note
- Notes are saved to `~/Library/Application\ Support/com.inclouds.apricot/notes.db`
- Pasted images are saved to the `~/Library/Application\ Support/com.inclouds.apricot/uploads` directory
- Undo/redo supports: creating notes, deleting notes, moving notes, and command-click operations
- Multiple notes can be moved or deleted as a single undoable action
- There is a "Share" canvas option that doesn't work publicly yet, but will export a canvas to a static html file.
